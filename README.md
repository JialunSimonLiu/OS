# Oscillator-Strength-of-Hydrogen-Like-Atoms
Oscillator strength (OS) and its perturbations in one electron system atoms are studied in this paper numerically by using the Numerov method. OS is a measure of electron transition probability between the two transition energy levels in an atom. One electron system atoms, or in other words, Hydrogen like atoms, are the main subjects to be discussed and compared, on account of their simple structures which have a single electron in the outer shell. Perturbation theory (PT) was used in this paper to study OS under perturbation of Zeeman Effect (ZE) which occurs when atoms are under the influence of magneticfields. The three types of ZE that are perturbed separately are **Normal Zeeman Effect (NZE), Internal Zeeman effect (IZE) and Anomalous Zeeman effect (AZE)**.
