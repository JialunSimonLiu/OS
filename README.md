# Oscillator-Strength-of-Hydrogen-Like-Atoms
The numerical/analytical solutions of the Oscillator strength (OS) and its perturbations in one electron system atoms are presented here. The three types of perturbation studied are **Normal Zeeman Effect (NZE), Internal Zeeman effect (IZE) and Anomalous Zeeman effect (AZE)**.
**What is the OS:** OS is a measure of electron transition probability between the two transition energy levels in an atom. One electron system atoms, or in other words, Hydrogen like atoms, are the main subjects to be discussed and compared, on account of their simple structures which have a single electron in the outer shell. 

**Analytical results:**
Derivitions are demonstrated in the paper, "Perturbed oscillator strengths in one electron system atoms".
