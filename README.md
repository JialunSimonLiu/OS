# Oscillator Strength of Hydrogen Like Atoms
The analytical/numerical solutions of the Oscillator strength (OS) and its perturbations in one electron system atoms are presented here. The three types of perturbation studied are **Normal Zeeman Effect (NZE), Internal Zeeman effect (IZE) and Anomalous Zeeman effect (AZE)**.
**What is the OS:** OS is a measure of electron transition probability between the two transition energy levels in an atom. One electron system atoms, or in other words, Hydrogen like atoms, are the main subjects to be discussed and compared, on account of their simple structures which have a single electron in the outer shell. 

**The basic idea of the algorithm:** Initially, I implemented the Numerov method to obtain the numerical solutions of electron wave-functions in bound states and modeled the electron distributions within hydrogen-like atoms using python. As a result, I derived the analytical formula of the transition probability (TP) in a neutral atom. By reconstructing this formula of TP under various energy perturbations, I devised more accurate equations than the ones from “Physics of Atoms and Molecules” by B. H. Bransden. In comparison with this text, my work has taken account of the additional energy form the intrinsic magnetic fields inside of atoms in addition to the external one. 

**How to run the codes?** Run the file, Perturbation models for Hydrogen.ipynb to achieve the numerical solutions.

**Analytical results:**
Derivations are demonstrated in the paper, "Perturbed oscillator strengths in one electron system atoms".
